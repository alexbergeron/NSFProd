# NSFProd

> Test post please ignore

This repo is something I wanted to create for a while now. It will mostly be a playground where I explore certain ideas current and former colleagues would probably never let me though code reviews (hence, NSFProd).

I started it three days into my post-Nescala 2015 blues, so my personal coding ideals are very high at the time of year.

I'm also trying to use [non/cats](https://github.com/non/cats) as my basis for how I will procede with using FP concepts in this project.

At this time, only an untested List implementation exists (I need to go to sleep...), but I've got a few ideas. Also, everything is kept invariant, even through some people just want things to be covariant all the time because some people are convinced that it's the best thing since sliced bread (it's not).
